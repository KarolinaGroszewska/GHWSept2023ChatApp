# ChatApp

A Flutter project for GHW Septemeber 2023: Web3 Week. Currently, this is a UI prototype of a messaging application + authentication using Metamask. 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Web3 + Flutter chat application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

For additional features worth implemeting, I recommend:
- Connecting Metamask to messaging portion.
- Have individual messenger clicks lead to the specific person.
- Implement state logging and sending messages.
- Connect messaging portion to other providers.

This was my first Flutter project, and also my first Web3 project, so I had a blast learning tons of new things and really look forward to seeing what else can be done with it :)
